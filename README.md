# memory-game

Play a memory game

## To-Do:

- For every guess made, increment a score variable and display the score while the game is played.
- Add a timer displayed during the game, show last game's time when finished.
- Store the best time of a game in local storage, so that players can see a record of the best game played.
- Allow for any number of cards to appear, rather than always using the same deck - easy, medium, hard
  --> 8 cards, 24 cards, 48 cards
- Instead of hard-coding colors, try something different like random colors or even images.
  --> (need at least 24 unique climate energy related items)
