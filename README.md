# memory-game

Play a memory game

## To-Do:

- Add a button that when clicked will restart the game once it has ended.
--> playStatus- finished == change text content of startGame to be "playAgain", update visibility of landing page
- For every guess made, increment a score variable and display the score while the game is played.
- Store the lowest-scoring game in local storage, so that players can see a record of the best game played.
- Allow for any number of cards to appear, rather than always using the same deck.
- Instead of hard-coding colors, try something different like random colors or even images.
